Alternatively, a safer memory copying function like `memcpy_s` from Microsoft's SafeString library or `strlcpy` from OpenBSD could be used, which provide additional bounds checking.\"\n}\n```\n- **Line 1437:** ```json\n{\n    \"vulnerability_type\": \"potential buffer overflow\",\n    \"severity\": \"medium\",\n    \"description\": \"The _TIFFmemcpy function copies 3*sizeof(float) bytes from the coeffs buffer to ycbcr->coeffs. However, there is no check to ensure that ycbcr->coeffs has enough allocated memory to hold the copied data. If the allocated memory for ycbcr->coeffs is smaller than 3*sizeof(float), this could lead to a buffer overflow.\",\n    \"suggested_fix\": \"Before calling _TIFFmemcpy, ensure that ycbcr->coeffs has enough allocated memory to hold 3*sizeof(float) bytes. You can either allocate a sufficient amount of memory dynamically or use a fixed-size buffer with a size check before copying the data.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Quick Fix\nUse strncpy() with proper bounds checking or std::string\n\n### Help\n[View CWE Details](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"
